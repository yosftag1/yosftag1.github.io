## About Me

I’m a machine learning engineer and researcher with experience across computer vision, NLP, explainable AI, and biomedical signal processing. My work focuses on the research, design, and development of advanced machine learning systems, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and real-world applicability across domains.

Currently, I work as an ML Engineer at Contrast AI, where I contribute to the research and design of generative computer-vision models for medical imaging. Previously, I was a research assistant at SRTA-City under [Dr. Shaimaa Lazem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaimaalazem), where I worked on explainable AI for NLP and evaluation frameworks for large language models. I’ve led research projects including graph-based transformer models for neurodegenerative disease classification and data-centric approaches for analyzing bias and errors in NLP systems.

more about my work can be found in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

## Interests

My interests lie at the intersection of foundational machine learning and real-world applications:

- **Deep Learning & Architecture Design**: Novel architectures, generative models, representation learning
- **Computer Vision**: Medical imaging, generative models, image-to-image translation
- **Trustworthy AI**: Explainability, fairness, robustness, and human-AI alignment
- **Applied ML**: End-to-end systems for healthcare, NLP, and signal processing  
- **Data-Centric AI**: Systematic approaches to improve data quality and model reliability

I am driven to advance **socially responsible AI** — building systems that have meaningful, positive impact on society.
