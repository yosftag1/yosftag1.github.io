## About Me

I am a machine learning engineer with research experience spanning NLP, explainability, computer vision, and signal processing. As a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Shaimaa Lazem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaimaalazem), I have investigated methods for integrating explainability and trustworthiness into NLP models development and am currently developing a systematic qualitative evaluation framework for the use of LLM agents in educational settings.

I'm currently also working as an ML engineer, where I focus on developing generative computer-vision systems for medical imaging applications. more about it here:([portfolio](/portfolio/medical-imaging-ai/)).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of foundational machine learning and real-world applications.  
I am also interested in deep learning architecture design.  
I want to work on methods that improve how models form internal representations and perform sequential decision-making and inference, aiming to create novel algorithms and architectures for cutting-edge problems.  
I am driven to advance socially responsible AI: I want to build transparent, robust, and trustworthy systems for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and education, with work that spans privacy and fairness research as well as interpretable evaluation and humanâ€“AI interaction to ensure model behavior aligns with user needs.

## Current Research

I'm developing a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models as autonomous agents in educational applications. This work introduces a novel rubric-based evaluation system that moves beyond purely quantitative metrics, enabling qualitative and holistic assessment of model performance in real-world educational scenarios.
