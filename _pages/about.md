## About Me

I am a machine learning engineer with research experience spanning NLP, explainability, computer vision, and signal processing. As a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Shaimaa Lazem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaimaalazem), I have investigated methods for integrating explainability and trustworthiness into NLP models development and am currently developing a systematic qualitative evaluation framework for the use of LLM agents with focus educational settings.

I'm currently also working as an ML engineer, where I focus on developing generative computer-vision systems for medical imaging applications. more about it here:([portfolio](/portfolio/medical-imaging-ai/)).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of foundational machine learning and real-world applications.  
I am also interested in deep learning architecture design.  
I want to work on methods that improve how models form internal representations and perform sequential decision-making and inference, aiming to create novel algorithms and architectures for cutting-edge problems.  
I am driven to advance socially responsible AI: I want to build transparent, robust, and trustworthy systems for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and education, with work that spans privacy and fairness research as well as interpretable evaluation and human–AI interaction to ensure model behavior aligns with user needs.

## Current Research

I'm developing a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models as autonomous agents in educational applications. This work introduces a novel rubric-based evaluation system that moves beyond purely quantitative metrics, enabling qualitative and holistic assessment of model performance in real-world educational scenarios.
