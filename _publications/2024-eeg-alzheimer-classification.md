This research presents a novel graph-based transformer architecture that integrates spatial-temporal EEG features for the classification of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia. The work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in biomedical signal processing applications.

## Key Achievements

- Designed and implemented a novel graph-based transformer integrating spatial–temporal EEG features (relative band power, spectral coherence)
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 99.1% accuracy (7–18 percentage points above reported SOTA)
- Built an end-to-end processing pipeline and benchmarked classical ML vs. deep learning approaches
- Led a multi-team project, owning the full EEG classification pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation
