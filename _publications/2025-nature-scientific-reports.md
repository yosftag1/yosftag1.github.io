## Abstract

The interest in data-centric AI has been recently growing. As opposed to model-centric AI, data-centric approaches aim at iteratively and systematically improving the data throughout the model life cycle rather than in a single pre-processing step.

**X-Deep Framework**: A Human-in-the-Loop framework designed to debug NLP datasets using Explainable AI techniques.

## Explainable AI Analysis

*LIME and SHAP outputs revealing how repeated words influence emotion classification*

## Key Contributions

- **Case Study**: Emotion detection in Arabic text using LIME and SHAP
- **Multi-Classifier Analysis**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, GRU, MARBERT
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identified spurious correlations, bias patterns, and anomalies
- **Actionable Insights**: Mitigation strategies for improved data collection and augmentation
