As a Machine Learning Engineer at **Contrast AI**, I lead the research and development of generative computer vision models for clinical applications. My work focuses on overcoming data scarcity and improving diagnostic quality through **novel deep learning architectures** and **data-centric AI pipelines**.

I specialize in building **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **U-Net** based architectures that surpass current state-of-the-art results, ensuring models are robust enough for real-world clinical deployment.

|------|-------------|
| **SOTA Performance** | Developed generative models surpassing literature baselines in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and expert clinical review |
| **Pipeline Engineering** | Designed end-to-end training/inference pipelines ensuring reproducibility in clinical settings |
| **Architecture Design** | Implemented custom GAN and U-Net variants with optimized loss functions for medical data |
| **Production AI** | Integrated models into product workflows with comprehensive performance monitoring |

## Technical Stack

| Category | Tools & Technologies |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras |
| **Architectures** | CycleGAN, U-Net, Transformers |
| **Computer Vision** | Image-to-Image Translation, Segmentation |
| **MLOps** | Pipeline automation, Experiment tracking, Model versioning |

## Core Responsibilities

- **Research & Development**: Conducting R&D on cutting-edge computer vision models for medical imaging.
- **Custom Solutions**: Developing custom loss functions, data-augmentation strategies, and preprocessing solutions to handle high-variance medical data.
- **Modular Architecture**: Building highly modular codebases to support rapid experimentation and collaboration with Ph.D. researchers.
- **Clinical Integration**: Ensuring model performance translates from research benchmarks to reliable clinical utility.

## Impact

My work directly bridges the gap between research and clinical application. By developing clearer, higher-quality generative imaging models, we enable more accurate diagnostics and reduce the dependency on large-scale labeled datasets. The models are currently deployed in **production clinical environments**.
