## Project Overview

This project presents a novel graph-based transformer architecture for the classification of Alzheimer's Disease using filtered EEG signals. The work was conducted as part of my Bachelor's thesis and represents a significant advancement in biomedical signal processing.

## Key Features

- **Novel Architecture**: Designed and implemented a graph-based transformer integrating spatial–temporal EEG features
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilized relative band power and spectral coherence features
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieved 99.1% accuracy, surpassing reported state-of-the-art by 7–18 percentage points
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Built comprehensive processing pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation
- **Benchmarking**: Compared classical ML vs. deep learning approaches

## Technical Implementation

- **Technologies**: Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn
- **Signal Processing**: EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, spectral analysis
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Custom graph transformer architecture
- **Machine Learning**: Comparative analysis of classical and deep learning methods

## Results

The project achieved remarkable results with 99.1% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The work demonstrates the potential of graph-based approaches in biomedical signal processing applications.

## Publication Status

This work is currently under review at Elsevier Biomedical Signal Processing and Control journal, where I serve as the first author responsible for design, analysis, and drafting.

## Code Repository

The complete implementation is available on GitHub: [github.com/yosftag1/eeg-alzheimer-classification](https://github.com/yosftag1/eeg-alzheimer-classification)
